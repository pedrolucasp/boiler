# Boiler
A dead-simple ready-to-work skeleton project

It comes with jQuery 2.1.1 (CDN - Minified Version) and with
**Normalize.css** as a Reset, also includes a *main.sass* to begin with.

**Colors included on main.sass** 
```
#000000 - for text
#ffffff - for background
#1EAEDB - for links
```

## Boiler.sh
Now it comes with `boiler.sh` to do all the dirty job for you.

**How to use it**:

Run `./boiler simple [projectname]` - to create a simple structure (same as here)

Run `./boiler advanced [projectname]` - to create a more dev-friendly structure (models/controllers, etc)

It is just *minimalistic*

### To-do
Rewrite `boiler.sh` to be more organized and simple.

## History

Version 2: Added a new script to do all the job
